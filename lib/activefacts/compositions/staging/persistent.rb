# This style of staging area contains a table for every source table,
# with injected foreign keys to a LoadBatch table, as for transient
# staging.
#
# Where it differs is that all unique constraints are disabled, and
# replaced by a primary key that is the source schema's PK appended
# with the LoadBatchID. Each record also has a ValidUntil timestamp,
# which is NULL for the most recent record. This allows a load batch
# to load a new version of any record, and the key value will be
# adjacent to the previous versions of that record.
#
# After a batch is complete, any updated record keys will address
# more than one record with a NULL ValidUntil timestamp, and this
# allows delta detection. As a delta is processed, the older record
# can be marked as valid only until the current LoadBatch time, or
# it can be deleted. If retained, a purge process can remove records
# that have exceeded their useful lifetime.
#
# Note that this approach doesn't directly detect deleted records.
# If the source system uses soft deletion, this generator can be
# configured with the name and value of the deleted flag field(s).
# This approach also works to manage CDC systems, which provide a
# record-deleted flag.
